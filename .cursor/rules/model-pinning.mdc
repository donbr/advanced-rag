# LLM & Embedding Model Pinning Rule

The application must **always** instantiate:

* `ChatOpenAI` with `model="gpt-4.1-mini"`
* `OpenAIEmbeddings` with `model="text-embedding-3-small"`

These values are considered part of the public contract of the server
(to reproduce answers deterministically and keep embedding dimensions
stable).  **Do not** change, override, or wrap these model identifiers
elsewhere in the codebase without first updating this rule and
performing a coordinated version bump across documentation and tests.
